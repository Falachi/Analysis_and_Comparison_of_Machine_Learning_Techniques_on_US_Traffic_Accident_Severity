**Abstract**

This study aims to create an accurate and effective prediction model for predicting severity in road traffic accidents. The severity is categorized based on the length of traffic is closed, and has a value range from 1 to 4. The study will also conduct experiments to find the most suitable model and sampling techniques required. Random forest that has its parameters tuned with an equal distributed target variable is found to be the best, with an accuracy of 65.9%.
